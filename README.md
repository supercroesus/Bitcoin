# Bitcoin

This is a Bitcoin analysis to identify when the good time to buy Bitcoin between Monday to Sunday.

It is started with buying $100 of Bitcoin every single day in 2010 until 2021.

It turns out if we bought Bitcoin on Saturday and Friday, we would acquire Bitcoin more, than the rest of the days.
