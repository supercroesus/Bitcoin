#### Bitcoin by Day of Week

This is a Bitcoin analysis to identify when the good time to buy Bitcoin between Monday to Sunday.

It is started with buying $100 of Bitcoin every single day in 2010 until 2021.

It turns out if we bought Bitcoin on Saturday and Friday, we would acquire Bitcoin more, than the rest of the days.

#####Bitcoin Logarithmic Regression Rainbow

Pardon for my code for this Logarithmic Regression. It's a bit messy. I use logarithmic regression to fit the Bitcoin price. It turns out that every time Bitcoin hits the upper band of the model, it indicates Bitcoin reaches the final blow off top.

The interesting thing is ... the next Bitcoin blow off top was located 2 bands below the previous blow off top band. Based on historical data, the lower blue bands means good time to accumulates Bitcoin and it takes off after leaving the blue bands.

As we can see in the picture 3, the accumulation phase after bull market always increase 1 band compared to the previous accumulation phase.
Green band -> Purple Band -> Orange Band -> Blue Band next?
